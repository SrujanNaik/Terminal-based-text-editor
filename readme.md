bugs:
#1.Cannot edit preious saves
        I can edit what i typed now but i cannot edit previous saves
#2.Random charactor are being saved
        some random charactor are being assined like when i press backspace # is saved etc.
#3.Insertion of new char in middle
        when i add char in middle it simply overwrites the char
        while saving too it do not insert in middle rather it insert at last


some thought
i think code is bit messy so i will fix and do better structured code
i will try to fix the bugs as i will learn another big concept
i may work on this later or do another similar kind of project
